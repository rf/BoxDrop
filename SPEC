We need plugin frameworks for:
   - Object storage (s3, db4, hbase, filesystem, etc)
   - Encryption (aes, blowfish, etc)
   - Compression (zlib, bzip2, pngcrush, flac, etc)
   - Diffing (diff, courgette, bsdiff, etc)
	- http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/

We have the following object types:
   - User
      - Passwords / public keys
      - ref to root tree
   - Tree
      - references to meta objects (files) or
      - references to other tree objects for subfolders
   - Meta
      - filename
      - mimetype
      - last modified
      - perms
      - list of frames
         - date of change
         - type of data (full file or delta)
         - reference to a blob
   - Blob
      - binary data
      - contains no other information
Each of these will have some kindof index so they can reference eachother;
just an autoincrementing int would suffice.


Currently a Message consists of the following data:
	first line is the size of the rest of the message (excluding this line)
	second line is the message type
